This is a multiplayer game I was working on for a bit in Unreal Engine 4. </br>
I stopped for the most part because I ran out of ideas, but also because the code </br>
is quite a mess and would need to be rewritten anyways. </br>
</br>

There's quite a bit of poor coding practices in here I'm not really proud of, </br>
although maybe it might be of help to someone. Very little of the project was done </br>
with blueprints so most of the game's logic will be in here.
